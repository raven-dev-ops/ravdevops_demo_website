# Raven Development Operations – Project Timeline (Draft)

This is a working draft of the delivery timeline for the Raven Development Operations demo website and supporting assets.

## Phase 1 – Initial Marketing Site

- ✅ Standalone marketing site with core pages (Home, Services, Portfolio, Blog, Pricing, About, Contact, Legal, 404).
- ✅ Animated hero, “trusted by” carousel, and testimonial sections.
- ✅ Netlify deployment (static hosting + Functions) with SPA routing.
- ✅ Basic contact flow and Calendly integration.

## Phase 2 – Assistant Backend (OpenAuxilium)

- ✅ Bootstrapped assistant backend (`OpenAuxilium`) with Express and `node-llama-cpp`.
- ✅ Chat API wired to the on-site chatbot.
- ✅ Contact enrichment endpoint integrated with the contact form.
- ⏳ Iterate on prompt flows and knowledge base content for the assistant.

## Phase 3 – Documentation & Owner Experience

- ✅ Establish NO LICENSE / all-rights-reserved model for the repo.
- ✅ Create internal wiki entry (`wiki.md`) summarizing structure and usage.
- ⏳ Expand this `timeline.md` with more granular milestones (e.g., individual sprints).
- ⏳ Maintain a curated `roadmap.md` for “what’s next”.

## Phase 4 – Future Enhancements (Ideas)

- ⏳ More robust test coverage for key pages and flows.
- ⏳ Additional demo scenarios for the chatbot and quizzes.
- ⏳ Deeper integrations (monitoring, error tracking, or additional scheduling providers).
