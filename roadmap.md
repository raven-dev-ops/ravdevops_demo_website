# Raven Development Operations – Roadmap (Draft)

This roadmap captures planned and potential enhancements for the Raven Development Operations demo website and assistant backend.

## Near-Term

- [ ] Flesh out `timeline.md` with more detailed milestones and dates.
- [ ] Add owner-facing guides for updating copy, pricing, and portfolio entries.
- [ ] Tighten assistant prompt templates and knowledge base topics.

## Medium-Term

- [ ] Add richer case studies with before/after metrics.
- [ ] Extend quizzes with more engagement types (e.g., observability audits, cost-optimization sprints).
- [ ] Improve CI/CD examples surfaced on the site (e.g., sample pipeline views, config snippets).

## Long-Term / Exploratory

- [ ] Optional authenticated “client portal” experience to view engagement status.
- [ ] More advanced chatbot flows (handoff, multi-step intake, deeper integrations).
- [ ] Additional marketing experiments and landing pages tailored to specific sectors.

> This roadmap is intentionally high-level. Use `wiki.md` as the hub for linking to more detailed implementation notes, experiments, and decisions.
